    "The most important principle of object orientation is **encapsulation**: \n",
    "- The idea that data inside the object should only be accessed through the object's methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, fname, lname):\n",
    "        self.fname = fname\n",
    "        self.lname = lname\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def email(self):\n",
    "        return \"{}.{}@email.com\".format(self.fname, self.lname)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `email` method is a good example of **encapsulation** philosophy. \n",
    "- Whenever we want to derive a new value from an action we call the method on the object. \n",
    "- It is considered a bad practice to retrieve the information from inside the object and write separate code to perform the action outside of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Encapsulation?\n",
    "- The functionality is defined in **one place and not in multiple places**.\n",
    "- It is defined in a logical place – the **place where the data is kept**.\n",
    "- Data inside our object is not modified unexpectedly by external code in a completely different part of our program.\n",
    "- When we use a method, we only need to know what result the method will produce. (abstraction)\n",
    "- We could switch to using another object which is completely different on the inside, and not have to change any code because both objects have the same interface.\n",
    "- If an object doesn't have an interface method which does what we want to do, we **SHOULD add a new method or update an existing one**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "- In Python, __encapsulation__ is not enforced by the language, \n",
    "- But to indicate that the variables are private, we begin its name with an underscore."
